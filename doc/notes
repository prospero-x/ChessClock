I started this project in June of 2016 when my Dad and I were playing chess. The
inspiration was to have a more competitive enviornment for playing chess 
(I still lost..)

The project grew pretty rapidly to a full-blown graphical interface with 
microsecond-resolution. The trickiest part was calibrating the clocks, because 
printing the timestamps to the user window takes longer than a CPU microsecond. 

If I had to do this project over, I would not use Tkinter. It's a pretty unforgivable
library and it behaves horribly across different platforms. ActiveTCL is required, 
and apt-get and friends are futile in properly installing the library.
